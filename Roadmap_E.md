1. Summary so far

- B-I = no OpenCV function, just snapshot 
- B-II = basic OpenCV functions

2. From B-I and B-II, what's next?


- Timeline
1. Phosifying all existing AI projects
2. Make Phos AI projects easy to code by beginners. Check number of beginners.
3. Automate GEISHA. Check output of GEISHA vs. human programmers.
4. TechSing = time when GEISHA automated outputs > human


As we have outlined in GEISHA README ....

Function to map graph search key to Phos words are themselves Phos words. Add this paragraph here.

All programs has memory and file output isolated from others, antithesis of graph database. Hence there is no avenue or possibility of cumulative intelligence. Intelligence has to be cumulative, accumulated from numerous minute operations. Only Phos words and graph database can facilitate this.


Intelligence may arise as large number of users on internet use Phos to process data and share as graph database.

Image to vocabulary annotation (derive key) can be manual. Then key may trigger other process.

## E. Miscellaneous Issues

But if we have built up momentum for GEISHA, we are already rich.  Then techsing is a different matter. 

1 2 5 years phosify all major open source software projects.



If not phos, someone else may have to invent something similar.




- What about WORSE with GEISHA?

<!-- Future: same, worse, better; 3 different scenarios. Possible factors for each scenario. -->

- Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

- a. Compare threats and opportunities in existing world + Internet WITHOUT GEISHA vs. world + Internet WITH GEISHA:

Harder to get jobs for old people, as knowledge and skills become easier to gain via technologies, but welfare could not catch up with technologies.

What about investment, agriculture, etc? Small robots for small farmers?

- b. Goods / Services vs. Prices: When USA impose tax on goods from China, it may not cause the amount of production to be reduced, but the goods may be sold to other lower price regions. This may help their economy in the long term.

Similarly with services &mdash; must differentiate Goods / Services from Price mechanism.


### II. Living WITH GEISHA: Threats and Benefits on the Livelihood of Individual Programmers

There maybe / are systems that resemble GEISHA without being identified as such as we speak.

2. If GEISHA exists and grows, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

- Forms of Artificial Intelligence Systems

- HLAI vs. super AI, formless etc.

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

Will it get worse with GEISHA? Extrapolate from threats and benefits in model WITHOUT GEISHA to model WITH GEISHA, e.g. jobs (benefitting some not but others) &mdash; existing threats and benefits; THEN conceive new threats and benefits WITH GEISHA.


Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.



<hr>

- Conclude here? Enough material for readers to think until next article?

How to wrap up?

<hr>

7. Why no breakthrough since Dartmouth AI conference?

- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 


8. The Tao of Geisha. Bad name.

The Tao of PhosBrain ??

Human, Robot, Computers, System Intelligence.
