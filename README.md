Graph Search Homoiconic Action GEISHA

- Calling this algorithm GEISHA carries a manga cyberpunk nuance, as if the AI system that we wish to create will serve human like a real world Japanese geisha.

Conventional artificial intelligence algorithms may be broadly classified into robotic and non-robotic categories, although of course adherents of particular disciplines may express differing opinions.

A fundamental question based on the categorisation above postulates:

- Since robots mimick human beings, is robotics more promising in achieving human level artificial intelligence (HLAI) first, before non-robotic category?

We believe we have conceived an algorithm that is applicable to both robotic and non-robotic AI, tentatively named "Graph Search and Act" (GSA):

1) We model the human mind with a graph database (GDB).

2) We postulate that external triggers (such as conversations, sound, light and other sensory events) and internal thoughts initiate searches in the graph database (modelling the human mind), hence the term "graph search".

3) Let us illustrate a graph search with the following example:

a) A CSV, F1, file contains a record of a person who is a cook.
F1 is linked to GDB by its full Linux path name (directory and filename), which is stored as a JSON string.

b) A search is triggered when the AI system AI1 receives a chat message from user U1 "where can I find a cook?"

c) One of the steps in the graph search involves simply the following:
```
grep cook F1
```
Or any equivalent function in any programming language.

d) When the rows in F1 containing "cook" are returned, we may also infer its "field name" e.g. "profession", which is usually at the top of the column concerned.

e) From above, we may conclude that "The profession of Mr X is a cook."

f) F1 may be linked to other records in GDB, which may lead us to infer "Mr X is Ms Y's husband."

g) As such, we have demonstrated that graph search may be used to construct relationships and the target objects of such relationship of a search subject.

h) Next, the search results described above is used to construct a conditional variable C1 which is used to map to an action A1.

To illustrate, a human person may think, "if he is a cook, then I will call him when I need to employ one."

Then A1 would be:
- search C1 for his phone number.

i) Action A1 has to be a homoiconic graph function (HGF):
- 1) A function in C/C++ or equivalent programming language is homoiconified using Phoscript Inverse Shunting Yard algorithm.
- 2) The homoiconified function word is stored in GDB.
