## Roadmap towards Technological Singularity
- Measured in the number of Phos WORDS (Homoiconic Graph Functions, HGF) in PhosGraph decentralized graph database (DCGDB)

<!-- Use this catch phrase to make it easy for readers understand -->

The concept of "technological singularity" dates at least two decades before being coined by Vernor Vinge in 1993, whose popularity was no doubted aided by the then nascent public access Internet and the microcomputer revolution, together with media portrayal of robotic apocalypse, from Terminator to the Matrix.

Despite the attention it receives, no one seems to be able to provide a concise roadmap, with objective metrics towards the realization of technological singularity (TechSing).

(We are inclined to use TechSing as the abbreviation as TS is now a common abbreviation for TypeScript, a programming language, as well as being easier to pronounce.)

So here is the essence of the answer of this article:

- Question: What are the objective metrics to measure our progress towards technological singularity?

- Answer: The number of Phos WORDS (homoiconic graph functions HGF) in PhosGraph decentralized graph database (DCGDB).

- Timeline
1. Phosifying all existing AI projects
2. Make Phos AI projects easy to code by beginners. Check number of beginners.
3. Automate GEISHA. Check output of GEISHA vs. human programmers.
4. TechSing = time when GEISHA automated outputs > human



## B. Demonstration with JavaScript OpenCV 

### B-I. [OpenCV Video Snapshot](https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/Roadmap_B_I.md)

### B-II. [OpenCV Basic Functions](https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/Collective_Intelligence_C.md)


### B-III. PhosCV / PhosGraph Details

var photo = canvasOutput.toDataURL('image/jpeg');   

The rest is PhosAjax.

## C. Timeline towards Technological Singularity

1. Summary so far

- B-I = no OpenCV function, just snapshot 
- B-II = basic OpenCV functions

2. From B-I and B-II, what's next?

As we have outlined in GEISHA README ....

Function to map graph search key to Phos words are themselves Phos words. Add this paragraph here.

All programs has memory and file output isolated from others, antithesis of graph database. Hence there is no avenue or possibility of cumulative intelligence. Intelligence has to be cumulative, accumulated from numerous minute operations. Only Phos words and graph database can facilitate this.


Intelligence may arise as large number of users on internet use Phos to process data and share as graph database.

Image to vocabulary annotation (derive key) can be manual. Then key may trigger other process.

Collective Intelligence 集思广益
