## Roadmap Towards Technological Singularity
- Measured in the number of Phos WORDS (Homoiconic Graph Functions, HGF) in PhosGraph decentralized graph database (DCGDB)

<!-- Use this catch phrase to make it easy for readers understand -->

The concept of "technological singularity" dates at least two decades before being coined by Vernor Vinge in 1993, whose popularity was no doubted aided by the then nascent public access Internet and the microcomputer revolution, together with media portrayal of robotic apocalypse, from Terminator to the Matrix.

Despite the attention it receives, no one seems to be able to provide a concise roadmap, with objective metrics towards the realization of technological singularity (TechSing).

(We are inclined to use TechSing as the abbreviation as TS is now a common abbreviation for TypeScript, a programming language, as well as being easier to pronounce.)

So here is the essence of the answer of this article:

- Question: What are the objective metrics to measure our progress towards technological singularity?

- Answer: The number of Phos WORDS (homoiconic graph functions HGF) in PhosGraph decentralized graph database (DCGDB).

The precise Timeline Towards Technological Singularity (TTTS) is given in section D of this article:

1. "Phosify" all existing AI and open source projects.
2. Make Phos AI projects easy to code by beginners. Measure the number of beginners.
3. Automate GEISHA. Measure output of GEISHA vs. human programmers.
4. Technological Singularity = time when GEISHA automated output > output by human programmers

In section B we describe several examples of "Phosification" (converting code in existing programming language into Phoscript), a procedure needed for building up GEISHA.

In section C we describe the rationale in deriving the Timeline Towards Technological Singularity, given in section D.
