## _GEISHA(0)_: Proof of Human Level Artificial Intelligence by Induction & a Universal Software Management System

- _A Dummy Artificial Intelligence System (DAIS) executes a program faithfully, one instruction after another, just like how a computer would, without making changes._

Although thatemthe ent above may sound counterintuitive, it however critically serves as a ___case 0 in a proof of induction for human level artificial intelligence (HLAI)___, called GEISHA (Graph Enhanced Intelligent Search with Homoiconic Actions). 

Yet, besides being a breakthrough towards HLAI, the DAIS concerned (GEISHA(0) or G0) also has  very practical applications, such as being a ___universal software management system___, which we shall demonstrate in this article.

### II. Universal Software Management System

Let us skip ___the proof of induction for human level artificial intelligence (HLAI)___ for now, and revisit it later, as it might be easier for readers to grasp the more practical concept of "software management system" first.

"Software management system" is a term we use to include, but not limited to, the following:

1. GitHub and similar systems

2. Integrated Development Environment Systems (IDE)

3. Human Programmers

4. GEISHA(0) or G0

Ours might be an unprecedented attempt to create a model to generalize entities as diverse as IDE and the human mind.

We would like to assure readers that the reason we are able to do this is due to breakthroughs in homoiconic metaprogramming &mdash; techniques in transforming source code in conventional programming languages into homoiconic forms (code and data can be manipulated in the same manners).


#### A. GEISHA(0) or G0

Let us first consider GEISHA case 0, GIESHA(0) or G0:

```
: G0 h0 h1 h2 h3 … … ;
```  
The notation above is called "colon definition" in Forth or similar programming language. The meaning of the parameters are:

- `:` start of colon definition
- `G0` word or function name to define
- `h0 h1 h2 h3 … …` list of words (functions) to execute
- `;` end of colon definition

It is a rather "primitive" yet useful notation to define a new function that predated the C programming langauge, which perhaps influenced all other subsequent modern programming languages.

So the expression above defines `G0` as a series of functions `h0 h1 h2 h3 … …`.

In modern C or equivalent, it would be:

```C
void G0()
{
    h0(); h1(); h2(); h3(); … …
}
```


G0 is simply any program written by human programmers which does not change by itself. 

We may euphemistically call G0 "Geisha Doll" or "Geisha Dummy".



There are at least two good signs concerning the robutness of the theory of GEISHA:

1. GEISHA can be expressed as a Forth / Phoscript colon definition word:

```
: G h0 g0 h1 g1 h2 g2 … … ;
```

2. GEISHA has a case 0 for proof by induction: GIESHA(0) or G0,

```
: G0 h0 h1 h2 h3 … … ;
```  

G0 is simply any program written by human programmers which does not change by itself. 

We may euphemistically call G0 "Geisha Doll" or "Geisha Dummy".

From a practical perspective, GEISHA provides programmers an alternative way of developing and maintaining software. It is actually flexible enough to be a universal interface to various existing software project structures, ranging from Java Eclipse to GitHub React projects such as Jitsi Meet, which we shall use as a first example for illustration.

Geisha Doll: A Universal Software Management System

Calling anything "universal" nowadays risks inviting skepticism.

Yet we feel that we must state what we truly believe in, until proven invalid.

In a previous article ...

- https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/README.md

If technological singularity sounds too remote to ordinary readers, then perhaps a "software management" system might be more relevant and practical.

In fact, we hope that the description of Geisha Doll as a software management system may convince readers of its potential as a realistic candidate to model human level artificial intelligence.

We understand that even this may sound too far-fetched as they are in fact  unprecedented claims. Yet we provide specific procedures to test our claims.
