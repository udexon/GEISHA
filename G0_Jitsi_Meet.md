## _GEISHA(0)_: Proof of Human Level Artificial Intelligence by Induction & a Universal Software Management System

- _A Dummy Artificial Intelligence System (DAIS) executes a program faithfully, one instruction after another, just like how a computer would, without making changes._

Although the statement above may sound counterintuitive, it however critically serves as a ___case 0 in a proof of induction for human level artificial intelligence (HLAI)___, called GEISHA (Graph Enhanced Intelligent Search with Homoiconic Actions).

Yet, besides being a breakthrough towards HLAI, the DAIS concerned (GEISHA(0) or G0) also has  very practical applications, such as being a ___universal software management system___, which we shall demonstrate in this article.

There are at least two good signs concerning the robutness of the theory of GEISHA:

1. GEISHA can be expressed as a Forth / Phoscript colon definition word:

```
: G h0 g0 h1 g1 h2 g2 … … ;
```

2. GEISHA has a case 0 for proof by induction G0.


```
: G0 h0 h1 h2 h3 … … ;
```  

G0 is simply any program written by human programmers which does not change by itself. 

We may euphemistically call G0 "Geisha Doll" or "Geisha Dummy".

From a practical perspective, GEISHA provides programmers an alternative way of developing and maintaining software. It is actually flexible enough to be a universal interface to various existing software project structures, ranging from Java Eclipse to GitHub React projects such as Jitsi Meet, which we shall use as a first example for illustration.

Geisha Doll: A Universal Software Management System

Calling anything "universal" nowadays risks inviting skepticism.

Yet we feel that we must state what we truly believe in, until proven invalid.

In a previous article ...

- https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/README.md

If technological singularity sounds too remote to ordinary readers, then perhaps a "software management" system might be more relevant and practical.

In fact, we hope that the description of Geisha Doll as a software management system may convince readers of its potential as a realistic candidate to model human level artificial intelligence.

We understand that even this may sound too far-fetched as they are in fact  unprecedented claims. Yet we provide specific procedures to test our claims.
