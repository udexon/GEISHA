There are at least two good signs concerning the robutness of the theory of GEISHA:

1. GEISHA can be expressed as a Forth / Phoscript colon definition word:

```
: G h0 g0 h1 g1 h2 g3 ….. ;
```

2. GEISHA has a case 0 for proof by induction G0.


```
: G0 h0 h1 h2 h3 ….. ;
```  

G0 is simply any program written by human programmers which does not change by itself. 

We may euphemistically call G0 "Geisha Doll" or "Geisha Dummy".
