G0 Jitsi Meet

There are at least two good signs concerning the robutness of the theory of GEISHA:

1. GEISHA can be expressed as a Forth / Phoscript colon definition word:

```
: G h0 g0 h1 g1 h2 g3 ….. ;
```

2. GEISHA has a case 0 for proof by induction G0.


```
: G0 h0 h1 h2 h3 ….. ;
```  

G0 is simply any program written by human programmers which does not change by itself. 

We may euphemistically call G0 "Geisha Doll" or "Geisha Dummy".

From a practical perspective, GEISHA provides programmers an alternative way of developing and maintaining software. It is actually flexible enough to be a universal interface to various existing software project structures, ranging from Java Eclipse to GitHub React projects such as Jitsi Meet, which we shall use as a first example for illustration.

Geisha Doll: A Universal Software Management System

Calling anything "universal" nowadays risks inviting skepticism.

Yet we feel that we must state what we truly believe in, until proven invalid.

In a previous article ...

If technological singularity sounds too remote to ordinary readers, then perhaps a "software management" system might be more relevant and practical.

In fact, we hope that the description of Geisha Doll as a software management system may convince readers of its potential as a realistic candidate to model human level artificial intelligence.

We understand that even this may sound too far-fetched as they are in fact  unprecedented claims. Yet we provide specific procedures to test our claims.
