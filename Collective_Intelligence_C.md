GEISHA introduces two novel features unavailable in conventional computing architecture:

- small (addressable and modifiable) functions and open access to the output of such functions.

In conventional computing architecture, a program is at least a few dozen lines up to millions of lines of code in length, and is usually not designed to share data with external entities at every stage of its execution.

We may draw parallels of GEISHA to what we know of human brain, made up of billions of neurons, which act as functional units, whose output are in turn openly available to any other neurons.

While existing systems that are commonly classified as "neuralÂ networks" exhibit "small node open access" with the program, the internal data are not available for open access in general.

Referring to the JavaScript OpenCV video snapshot example, we wish to illustrate how cumulative and collaborative intelligence may arise when large number of users or programmers collaborate using GEISHA.



Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.

The Tao of Geisha. Bad name.

The Tao of PhosBrain ??

Human, Robot, Computers, System Intelligence.
