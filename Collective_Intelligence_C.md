GEISHA introduces two novel features unavailable in conventional computing architecture:

- small (addressable and modifiable) functions and open access to the output of such functions.

In conventional computing architecture, a program is at least a few dozen lines up to millions of lines of code in length, and is usually not designed to share data with external entities at every stage of its execution.

We may draw parallels of GEISHA to what we know of human brain, made up of billions of neurons, which act as functional units, whose output are in turn openly available to any other neurons.

While existing systems that are commonly classified as "neural networks" exhibit "small node open access" with the program, the internal data are not available for open access in general.

## Incrementally Building an OpenCV Program, Collaboratively

Referring to the JavaScript OpenCV video snapshot example, we wish to illustrate how _cumulative and collaborative intelligence_ may arise when large number of users or programmers collaborate using GEISHA.

Due to the prevalence and dominance of the conventional computing architecture, few people would have thought of collaborating on a "simple" OpenCV program, comprising only rudimentary functions such as thresholding, smoothing, colour space transform etc.

We are only using this seemingly trivial example to illustrate how multiple programmers may collaborate using GEISHA, and then we wish to convince the readers of the usefulness of GEISHA when the number of programmers involved in collaboration scales towards 1 million and beyond.

To appreciate the benefits of incrementally building an OpenCV program by a group of programmers, let us look at Hu Ningxin's other OpenCV JS video-processing example (let's call this Program B) that consists of more functions:

- https://github.com/huningxin/opencv.js/blob/master/samples/video-processing/js/index.js
- https://github.com/huningxin/opencv.js/blob/master/samples/video-processing/index.html
- https://github.com/huningxin/opencv.js

Let's call the earlier example [program A](https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/Collective_Intelligence_%E9%9B%86%E6%80%9D%E5%B9%BF%E7%9B%8A.md#b-demonstration-with-javascript-opencv):

<img src="https://github.com/udexon/GEISHA/blob/main/img/PhosCV_Start.png" width=600>

Now imagine how you would do the following:

- start with program A, incrementally make changes to create program B
- start with program B, deconstruct it into components and create program A

Without using novel principles such as GEISHA, you may not be able to derive anything interesting ideas from the two problems described above. 

With GEISHA however, imagine now instead of being ONE single program like program B, we now have several _function words_, each corresponding to a feature in program B, and the output of the function words are available for open access via a graph database mechanism to other function words.

In this example, the number of function words may just be around a dozen or so. 

What if we continue to expand the set of function words to include other robotic functions, from kinematics to various types of sensors. This may increase the number of function words to several thousands.

Some readers may ask, is this not simply changing the API of existing functions to reverse rolish notation / stack machine? What actual benefits can it bring besides being obviously a layer of syntactic sugar?

Indeed, transforming functions in existing programming languages into Phos function words would merely be a layer of syntactic sugar, if they are not integrated into the graph database, where live functions triggered by graph database events may match Phos words to conditional variables, besides composing new Phos words or decomposing existing Phos words into their component words. 

Graph database events trigger new words ...


5. Highlight software engineering benefits of Phoscript, interface to all programming languages, hybrid API, easier to recruit new programmers for existing projects by simplifying code. 

- How to use Phoscript for debugging, maintenance and continuous improvement. 

- Geisha can clone all types of existing AI or robotic systems and improve them. This is the most practical and immediate benefits of GEISHA.

Besides low level OpenCV functions as shown in programs A and B, GEISHA may also be used to integrate much bigger and complex programs such as humanoid simulators, or complete social media services (front end and back end).

Essentially, Phoscript uses a single string word without space to address a function in the host programming language, and uses stacks to pass data between functions. As such it greatly simplifies the execution and modification of functions, making it possible to modify them easily while in execution, an achievement not possible using conventional programming languages. 

Although such mechanisms (opcode, stack and stack machine) are available at the interpreter level of most programming languages, they are not available to programmers as API. Phoscript effectively creates a high level stack machine, much like a sandwich, where the bread at the bottom represent the interpreter / compiler, the meat and vegetables in the middle represent source code, and the bread at the top is Phoscript code.


6. Phoscript alone is not sufficient to be a Eureka breakthrough for HLAI. It needs another magic ingredient:

- Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words.

Incidentally, the functions for Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words are themselves Phoscript words.

We should first describe the metaprogramming properties of Phoscript. Then add graph search to get complete picture of GEISHA.

Highlight metaprogramming and AI properties of Phos and GEISHA.

7. Why no breakthrough since Dartmouth AI conference?

- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

- a. Compare threats and opportunities in existing world + Internet WITHOUT GEISHA vs. world + Internet WITH GEISHA:

Harder to get jobs for old people, as knowledge and skills become easier to gain via technologies, but welfare could not catch up with technologies.

Will it get worse with GEISHA? Extrapolate from threats and benefits in model WITHOUT GEISHA to model WITH GEISHA, e.g. jobs (benefitting some not but others) &mdash; existing threats and benefits; THEN conceive new threats and benefits WITH GEISHA.

What about investment, agriculture, etc? Small robots for small farmers?

- b. Goods / Services vs. Prices: When USA impose tax on goods from China, it may not cause the amount of production to be reduced, but the goods may be sold to other lower price regions. This may help their economy in the long term.

Similarly with services &mdash; must differentiate Goods / Services from Price mechanism.

Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.
