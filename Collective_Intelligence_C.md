GEISHA introduces two novel features unavailable in conventional computing architecture:

- small (addressable and modifiable) functions and open access to the output of such functions.

In conventional computing architecture, a program is at least a few dozen lines up to millions of lines of code in length, and is usually not designed to share data with external entities at every stage of its execution.

We may draw parallels of GEISHA to what we know of human brain, made up of billions of neurons, which act as functional units, whose output are in turn openly available to any other neurons.

While existing systems that are commonly classified as "neuralÂ networks" exhibit "small node open access" with the program, the internal data are not available for open access in general.

## Incrementally Building an OpenCV Program, Collaboratively

Referring to the JavaScript OpenCV video snapshot example, we wish to illustrate how _cumulative and collaborative intelligence_ may arise when large number of users or programmers collaborate using GEISHA.

Due to the prevalence and dominance of the conventional computing architecture, few people would have thought of collaborating on a "simple" OpenCV program, comprising only rudimentary functions such as thresholding, smoothing, colour space transform etc.

We are only using this seemingly trivial example to illustrate how multiple programmers may collaborate using GEISHA, and then we wish to convince the readers of the usefulness of GEISHA when the number of programmers involved in collaboration scales towards 1 million and beyond.

Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.

The Tao of Geisha. Bad name.

The Tao of PhosBrain ??

Human, Robot, Computers, System Intelligence.
