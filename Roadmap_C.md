I. Phosifying all existing AI projects

1. Highlight software engineering benefits of Phoscript, interface to all programming languages, hybrid API, easier to recruit new programmers for existing projects by simplifying code. 

- How to use Phoscript for debugging, maintenance and continuous improvement. 

- Geisha can clone all types of existing AI or robotic systems and improve them. This is the most practical and immediate benefits of GEISHA.

Besides low level OpenCV functions as shown in programs A and B, GEISHA may also be used to integrate much bigger and complex programs such as humanoid simulators, or complete social media services (front end and back end).

Essentially, Phoscript uses a single string word without space to address a function in the host programming language, and uses stacks to pass data between functions. As such it greatly simplifies the execution and modification of functions, making it possible to modify them easily while in execution, an achievement not possible using conventional programming languages. 

Although such mechanisms (opcode, stack and stack machine) are available at the interpreter level of most programming languages, they are not available to programmers as API. Phoscript effectively creates a high level stack machine, much like a sandwich, where the bread at the bottom represent the interpreter / compiler, the meat and vegetables in the middle represent source code, and the bread at the top is Phoscript code.

2. Make Phos AI projects easy to code by beginners. Check number of beginners.

III. Automate GEISHA. Check output of GEISHA vs. human programmers.


- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 


1. Phoscript alone is not sufficient to be a Eureka breakthrough for HLAI. It needs another magic ingredient:

- Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words.

Incidentally, the functions for Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words are themselves Phoscript words.

We should first describe the metaprogramming properties of Phoscript. Then add graph search to get complete picture of GEISHA.

Highlight metaprogramming and AI properties of Phos and GEISHA.

- See example in README.


IV. TechSing = time when GEISHA automated outputs > human

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

<hr>

- Conclude here? Enough material for readers to think until next article?

How to wrap up?

<hr>

7. Why no breakthrough since Dartmouth AI conference?

- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

- a. Compare threats and opportunities in existing world + Internet WITHOUT GEISHA vs. world + Internet WITH GEISHA:

Harder to get jobs for old people, as knowledge and skills become easier to gain via technologies, but welfare could not catch up with technologies.

Will it get worse with GEISHA? Extrapolate from threats and benefits in model WITHOUT GEISHA to model WITH GEISHA, e.g. jobs (benefitting some not but others) &mdash; existing threats and benefits; THEN conceive new threats and benefits WITH GEISHA.

What about investment, agriculture, etc? Small robots for small farmers?

- b. Goods / Services vs. Prices: When USA impose tax on goods from China, it may not cause the amount of production to be reduced, but the goods may be sold to other lower price regions. This may help their economy in the long term.

Similarly with services &mdash; must differentiate Goods / Services from Price mechanism.

Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.


8. The Tao of Geisha. Bad name.

The Tao of PhosBrain ??

Human, Robot, Computers, System Intelligence.
