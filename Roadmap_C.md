### I. Phosifying all existing AI projects

1. Highlight software engineering benefits of Phoscript, interface to all programming languages, hybrid API, easier to recruit new programmers for existing projects by simplifying code. 

- How to use Phoscript for debugging, maintenance and continuous improvement. 

- Geisha can clone all types of existing AI or robotic systems and improve them. This is the most practical and immediate benefits of GEISHA.

Besides low level OpenCV functions as shown in programs A and B, GEISHA may also be used to integrate much bigger and complex programs such as humanoid simulators, or complete social media services (front end and back end).

Essentially, Phoscript uses a single string word without space to address a function in the host programming language, and uses stacks to pass data between functions. As such it greatly simplifies the execution and modification of functions, making it possible to modify them easily while in execution, an achievement not possible using conventional programming languages. 

Although such mechanisms (opcode, stack and stack machine) are available at the interpreter level of most programming languages, they are not available to programmers as API. Phoscript effectively creates a high level stack machine, much like a sandwich, where the bread at the bottom represent the interpreter / compiler, the meat and vegetables in the middle represent source code, and the bread at the top is Phoscript code.

### III. Automate GEISHA. Check output of GEISHA vs. human programmers.


- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 


1. Phoscript alone is not sufficient to be a Eureka breakthrough for HLAI. It needs another magic ingredient:

- Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words.

Incidentally, the functions for Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words are themselves Phoscript words.

We should first describe the metaprogramming properties of Phoscript. Then add graph search to get complete picture of GEISHA.

Highlight metaprogramming and AI properties of Phos and GEISHA.

- See example in README.


IV. TechSing = time when GEISHA automated outputs > human


## D. Threats and Benefits of AI: Now, Towards and Beyond Technological Singularity

GEISHA provides a theoretical basis on which we may analyze the threats and benefits of artificial intelligence systems.

Contemporaneous commnetators on technological singularity usually highlights ethical issues on military robots, e.g. how or if it is possible to control a HLAI robot soldiers or more intelligent systems or entities.

We would like to investigate this issue from a different perspective, that of the economic perspetive.

More specifically, we propose to analyze the existential crises that may affect individual programmers, in scenarios where GEISHA exists or otherwise.

In plain English:

1. Without GEISHA, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

2. If GEISHA exists and grows, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

- Forms of Artificial Intelligence Systems

- HLAI vs. super AI, formless etc.

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

- a. Compare threats and opportunities in existing world + Internet WITHOUT GEISHA vs. world + Internet WITH GEISHA:

Harder to get jobs for old people, as knowledge and skills become easier to gain via technologies, but welfare could not catch up with technologies.

Will it get worse with GEISHA? Extrapolate from threats and benefits in model WITHOUT GEISHA to model WITH GEISHA, e.g. jobs (benefitting some not but others) &mdash; existing threats and benefits; THEN conceive new threats and benefits WITH GEISHA.

What about investment, agriculture, etc? Small robots for small farmers?

- b. Goods / Services vs. Prices: When USA impose tax on goods from China, it may not cause the amount of production to be reduced, but the goods may be sold to other lower price regions. This may help their economy in the long term.

Similarly with services &mdash; must differentiate Goods / Services from Price mechanism.

Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.

As we have outlined in GEISHA README ....

Function to map graph search key to Phos words are themselves Phos words. Add this paragraph here.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity



All programs has memory and file output isolated from others, antithesis of graph database. Hence there is no avenue or possibility of cumulative intelligence. Intelligence has to be cumulative, accumulated from numerous minute operations. Only Phos words and graph database can facilitate this.


Intelligence may arise as large number of users on internet use Phos to process data and share as graph database.

Image to vocabulary annotation (derive key) can be manual. Then key may trigger other process.

Collective Intelligence 集思广益
