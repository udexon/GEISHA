### I. Phosifying all existing AI projects

1. Highlight software engineering benefits of Phoscript, interface to all programming languages, hybrid API, easier to recruit new programmers for existing projects by simplifying code. 

- How to use Phoscript for debugging, maintenance and continuous improvement. 

- Geisha can clone all types of existing AI or robotic systems and improve them. This is the most practical and immediate benefits of GEISHA.

Besides low level OpenCV functions as shown in programs A and B, GEISHA may also be used to integrate much bigger and complex programs such as humanoid simulators, or complete social media services (front end and back end).

Essentially, Phoscript uses a single string word without space to address a function in the host programming language, and uses stacks to pass data between functions. As such it greatly simplifies the execution and modification of functions, making it possible to modify them easily while in execution, an achievement not possible using conventional programming languages. 

Although such mechanisms (opcode, stack and stack machine) are available at the interpreter level of most programming languages, they are not available to programmers as API. Phoscript effectively creates a high level stack machine, much like a sandwich, where the bread at the bottom represent the interpreter / compiler, the meat and vegetables in the middle represent source code, and the bread at the top is Phoscript code.

- Describe examples multiple programmers can produce using GEISHA, with timelines. 


1. Phoscript alone is not sufficient to be a Eureka breakthrough for HLAI. It needs another magic ingredient:

- Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words.

Incidentally, the functions for Mapping graph search keys to Phoscript words are themselves Phoscript words.

We should first describe the metaprogramming properties of Phoscript. Then add graph search to get complete picture of GEISHA.

Highlight metaprogramming and AI properties of Phos and GEISHA.

- See example in README.


IV. TechSing = time when GEISHA automated outputs > human


## D. Threats and Benefits of AI: Now, Towards and Beyond Technological Singularity

GEISHA provides a theoretical basis on which we may analyze the threats and benefits of artificial intelligence systems.

Contemporaneous commnetators on technological singularity usually highlights ethical issues on military robots, e.g. how or if it is possible to control a HLAI robot soldiers or more intelligent systems or entities.

We would like to investigate this issue from a different perspective, that of the economic perspetive.

More specifically, we propose to analyze the existential crises that may affect individual programmers, in scenarios where GEISHA exists or otherwise.

In plain English:

1. Without GEISHA, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

2. If GEISHA exists and grows, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

### I. Without GEISHA: Threats and Benefits on the Livelihood of Individual Programmers

The generation of programmers born in 1970s may be a unique generation who are caught in the rise and trough of IT revolution that began in the 1990s:

- the post 1990 32-bit microprocessor IT boom 
- by mid 2010s, although the IT industry is still booming, globalization and commoditization of IT knowledge cause the "dilution of income" as younger programmers took away too much of the older programmers fair share before they can retire comfortably.

They are unique because the pace of IT revolution may slow down in the 2020s, and career welfare may have improved to ensure the 30 year olds in 2020 will not suffer as much in 2025 compared to those in the mid 40s in 2020.

Their experience and insights also provide clues for us to analyze and predict technological trends beyond 2020.

Most importantly:

- Will systems similar to GEISHA exists and grows in the 2020s, with or without conscious human intervention?

- How will GEISHA or similar systems affect the livelihood of programmers and non-programmers around the world, from the developed countries to developing countries?

Let us consider 3 possible scenarios concerning livelihood of "middle age programmers" from 2020 to 2030, and analyze the possible factors for each scenario.

1. Same, no change: the biggest "threat" to livelihood of "middle age programmers" are of course "younger programmers", as globalization and commoditization of technological knowledge make it extremely easy to learn and become a professional programmer.

By "SAME", we should say by 2025, programmers who are 35 years old are facing no more and no less threats compared to the 35 years old programmers in 2020.

However, as we may also assume that the user base of Internet and mobile phone will continue to grow, so there will be more young programmers in 2025 compared to 2020. For 35 years old programmers to not face increasing pressure from younger programmers in 2025, we must then find additional benecial factors to offset the increasing threats.

The most likely factor to offset the threats of greater number of young programmers would be the improvement in economic growth in China and other developing countries, providing more jobs and income to the greater overall number of programmers worldwide.

2. Worse: The number of young programmers increase from 2020 to 2025, while world economy stagnates or gets worse.

3. Better: with GEISHA. 

We believe it is unlikely for the world economy to get better from 2020 to 2025 without GEISHA, as 2020 has suffered the worst pandemic in recent history.

As such, let us consider how GEISHA may change the software industry and affect the world from 2020 until 2030.

One of the most fundamental exercise in GEISHA is the manual conversion (by human programmer) of existing source code of open source projects in various host programming languages into Phoscript. This process may be automated once the initial "Phosification" prototypes are in place. Let us consider the following scenarios:

1. It takes 1 year (most optimistic measure) to convert major GNU tools and open source projects to Phoscript: e.g. GNU C Compiler, PHP interpreter engine, .... LibreOffice etc.

2. It takes 2 years to accomplish the above.

3. It takes 5 years to accomplish the above.

4. It takes 10 years to accomplish the above.
 

These targets are deterministic. The main variable in the above scenarios is publicity &mdash; how effective is GEISHA Phoscript promotion program to convince and recruit free software programmers to participate.

The most important factor is however non-deterministic &mdash; internal GEISHA conditions to actions mapping. 

- When will GEISHA reach the "point of no return" (PONR) or "avalanche threshold" i.e. GEISHA has sufficient fundamental metaprogramming functions that it no longer requires human input to expand its database?

PONR may hit at 1%, 10%, 20%, 50% or 90% of converting existing code. Or it may come much later. At this point, we simply do not sufficient empirical data to predict the behaviour of GEISHA. This situation may improve in the coming weeks or months.

But if we have built up momentum for GEISHA, we are already rich.  Then techsing is a different matter. 

1 2 5 years phosify all major open source software projects.



If not phos, someone else may have to invent something similar.




- What about WORSE with GEISHA?

<!-- Future: same, worse, better; 3 different scenarios. Possible factors for each scenario. -->

- Define intelligence in terms of threats and opportunities, to benefits and survival of self.

- a. Compare threats and opportunities in existing world + Internet WITHOUT GEISHA vs. world + Internet WITH GEISHA:

Harder to get jobs for old people, as knowledge and skills become easier to gain via technologies, but welfare could not catch up with technologies.

What about investment, agriculture, etc? Small robots for small farmers?

- b. Goods / Services vs. Prices: When USA impose tax on goods from China, it may not cause the amount of production to be reduced, but the goods may be sold to other lower price regions. This may help their economy in the long term.

Similarly with services &mdash; must differentiate Goods / Services from Price mechanism.


### II. Living WITH GEISHA: Threats and Benefits on the Livelihood of Individual Programmers

There maybe / are systems that resemble GEISHA without being identified as such as we speak.

2. If GEISHA exists and grows, what are the factors that are threntening the livelihood of a programmer today, or in the next 2, 5 and 10 years?

- Forms of Artificial Intelligence Systems

- HLAI vs. super AI, formless etc.

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

- Can GEISHA produce humanoid, simulated humanoid, formless AI, or other types of AI?

Will it get worse with GEISHA? Extrapolate from threats and benefits in model WITHOUT GEISHA to model WITH GEISHA, e.g. jobs (benefitting some not but others) &mdash; existing threats and benefits; THEN conceive new threats and benefits WITH GEISHA.


Micro entity may have self awareness.

Macro entity may not, or may, against bigger environment. Earth vs. Internet.

The rules are like flowing water. Transfer of energy, high price to low price. Etc.

As we have outlined in GEISHA README ....

Function to map graph search key to Phos words are themselves Phos words. Add this paragraph here.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity



All programs has memory and file output isolated from others, antithesis of graph database. Hence there is no avenue or possibility of cumulative intelligence. Intelligence has to be cumulative, accumulated from numerous minute operations. Only Phos words and graph database can facilitate this.


Intelligence may arise as large number of users on internet use Phos to process data and share as graph database.

Image to vocabulary annotation (derive key) can be manual. Then key may trigger other process.

Collective Intelligence 集思广益
